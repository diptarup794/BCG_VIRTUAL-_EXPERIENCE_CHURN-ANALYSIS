# BCG_VIRTUAL-_EXPERIENCE_CHURN-ANALYSIS
This repository contains the analysis performed for PowerCo, a gas and electricity utility company, to identify key drivers of customer churn and develop data-driven strategies for churn reduction. The analysis was conducted as part of the BCG Virtual DataScience Experience.

Problem: PowerCo experienced significant customer churn, particularly in the SME segment, following the liberalization of the energy market. They partnered with BCG to analyze customer data and recommend strategies to retain customers.

Data:

Historical customer data (usage, sign-up date, forecasted usage)
Historical pricing data (fixed & variable costs)
Churn indicator (churned/not churned)
Analysis:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed customer demographics, usage patterns, and pricing plans.
Identified potential churn predictors through visualizations and descriptive statistics.
Feature Engineering:
Created additional features based on existing data, such as customer tenure, average monthly bill, and price sensitivity.
Churn Modeling:
Built and compared different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict customer churn.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Driver Analysis:
Interpreted the model to identify the most important features influencing churn.
Analyzed how different factors like price, usage, and customer segment contributed to churn.
Results:

Identified key churn drivers such as high energy consumption, low customer tenure, and price dissatisfaction.
Developed a churn prediction model with high accuracy to identify at-risk customers.
Provided actionable insights and recommendations for targeted retention strategies (e.g., personalized pricing plans, loyalty programs, contract renegotiation offers).
Next Steps:

Refine the churn model with additional data sources and features.
Implement and validate the proposed retention strategies through A/B testing.
Track and monitor churn metrics to measure the effectiveness of the implemented strategies.
Additional Materials:

Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis code and visualizations.
Model evaluation reports and interpretation of key drivers.
Presentation slides summarizing the findings and recommendations.
This analysis demonstrates the power of data science in tackling customer churn challenges. By leveraging machine learning and data-driven insights, PowerCo can develop effective strategies to retain valuable customers and enhance its competitive advantage in the liberalized energy market.
